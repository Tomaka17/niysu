<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install Niysu, the first to do is to install <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>.
<strong>Composer</strong> is a dependency manager which allows you to easily install and upgrade any PHP library you depend upon.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, write a <code>composer.json</code> file in the main directory of your website:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">
{
    "require": {
    	"tomaka17/niysu": "dev-master"
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This will tell <strong>Composer</strong> that you have a dependency on <strong>Niysu</strong>.</p>

<p>Now open a shell, and type:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">composer install</pre>

<p>This will install Niysu and all its dependencies in the <code>vendor</code> directory.</p>

<p>Now to use Niysu in a PHP script, simply add this line at the top of the script:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">>
require 'vendor/autoload.php';			// change the path if you are not in the main directory
</pre>
