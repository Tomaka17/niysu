<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Installing composer</h3>

<p>To install Niysu, the first thing to do is to install <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>.
<strong>Composer</strong> is a small PHP script which allows you to easily install and upgrade any PHP library you depend upon.</p>

<p>Simply follow <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix">these instructions</a> in order to install composer.</p>

<h3>Downloading and installing Niysu</h3>

<p>Now we will tell composer that we want to use Niysu, and it will download it for us. To do so, write a <code>composer.json</code> file in the main directory of your website and put this inside:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">
{
    "require": {
    	"tomaka17/niysu": "dev-master"
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Now open a shell, and type:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">composer install</pre>

<p>This will install Niysu and all its dependencies in the <code>vendor</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Writing your first script</h3>

<p>Niysu is a <strong>front controller</strong>, which means that every single request must pass through it (except static resources if you wish so, for performances reasons).
This means that you must write a file (for example <code>index.php</code>) which will handle every requests received by your server, and which will dispatch it to the right controller.</p>

<p>Here is an example <code>index.php</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">
&lt;php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$server = new \Niysu\Server();

$server->register('/', 'get', function($plainTextOutput) {
	$plainTextOutput->setText('Hello world!');
});

$server->handle();
</pre>

<h3>Setting up the web server</h3>

<p>You need to set up your web server so that it redirects every single request to your <code>index.php</code>.</p>

<h4>PHP test server</h4>

<p>Since version 5.4, PHP comes with an internal web server for testing purposes.</p>

<p>Just type this is a shell in the directory of your <code>index.php</code>, and it will start the server:</p>

<pre><code>php -S localhost:80 index.php</code></pre>
