<h2>Services, contexts, filters, inputs and outputs</h2>

<p>Niysu provides a lot of useful services. A service is an object which allows to easily do most of the things that a web server usually does.
Examples of services: database, authentication, twig, caching.</p>

<p>To access a service, all you need to do is use its name as a parameter.</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$server->register('/', 'get', function($databaseService) {
	/* you can use the $databaseService here */
});
</pre>

<p>Services are only created if you ask them. For example if you never use a database on your server, then the database service will never be created.</p>
